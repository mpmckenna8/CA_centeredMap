To create the cali.json file downloaded a couple of shape files from Natural Earth.
  -The Administrative boundaries for states provinces and lakes.
  -Also the populated places point data on cities w/ significant populations.

On a mac running Lion in the terminal I already have all the necessary things installed from Mike Bostocks "Let's make a
map tutorial."


So once I had the data in terminal I run the following:
  
  1.
  ogr2ogr \
  -f GeoJSON\
  -where "name IN ('California')" \
  casubun.json \
  ne_50m_admin_1_states_provinces_lakes_shp.shp

  2.
  ogr2ogr \
  -f GeoJSON \
  -where "ADM1NAME = 'california'" \
  calcities.json \
  ne_10m_populated_places.shp

  3.
  topjson \
  --id-property iso_a2 \
  -p name=NAME \
  -o cali.json \
  casubun.json \
  calcities.json

I ran these in the termial to create my cali.json file which has point data from some of the larger CA cities in it.  I didn't make use of these points for my Giants colored CA map because I didn't have any good reason to and labeling them would have been annoying, espcially which the concentration of quite a few cities in small areas like the Bay Area.
